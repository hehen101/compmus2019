# Pop Hits 

*Introduction* 

I started this project with thinking about what I am interested in and what kind of music I listen to the most. After a while I decided that I wanted to work with popular music, since this is the genre that I have been listening to for years - at least in my freetime at home. So I decided to have a look at the charts from 2000 and 2018 because I thought in these 18 years there has been a huge change when it comes to popular music, especially taking in account the major hip hop/rap rise with Drake, XXXTension, Post Malone and so on. After comparing the Billboard Top Charts from 2000 to the songs from 2018 I realized that this two playlists didn't satisfied what I had in mind. So I decided to change my project from this to a rather personal, based on selfmade playlists project. I have been using Spotify for years now, listening to music for ceveral hours every day; I love the variety of music, the ability of creating your own playlists, the premium account with no ads, better sound quality and of course the ability to download playlists.
