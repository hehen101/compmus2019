# Pop Hits 
I decided to compare songs from the year 2000 to songs from 2018. I tried to find suitable playlists on Spotify, but all of the them contained songs that were from different years, too, for example all of the 2010 playlists were mainly based on songs from the early 2000's like 2003-2005. So I decided to create my own playlist, using the Billboard Top 100 Charts,which I found on  Wikipedia, so I would have two similar playlists with the same background and amount of songs, which I could compare. I was especially interested in the danceability and tempo, because I thought these two features would be very different. 

I knew almost all of the songs from 2018, whereas I had to listen to a lot of the one's from 2000 to get to know them since I didn't knew a lot of them. The corpus so far is based on the two playlist, containing 98 songs for 2000, two are missing because they weren't on Spotify, and 100 songs for 2018. Remarkable about the 2018 list was, that a lot songs were from the same singer/band. 

Remarkable is that in the 2000 playlist only 4 songs are above <0,9 % in danceability whereas for the 2018 there were 10. The tempo was rather similuar though, which I would not have expected. I haven't seen any major outliers so far but I might extend the list for some big hits which weren't mentioned in the Top Hits for those year just to get a bitter corpus with some relatable informationen.
